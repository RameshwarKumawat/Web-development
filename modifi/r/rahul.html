			<h3>Grade Point Average (GPA)</h3>
				<p class="define"> GPA is a measure to calculate Individual’s performance in any academic course. Grade is calculated on the basis of relative merit of marks obtained in any particular subject as per the following table. </p>
			<table align="center" class="profile-table">
				<tr>
					<th>Criteria</th>

			<p>Average of all the grades is calculated according to a specified formula (mentioned below). This average of all the Grades is known as Grade Point Average or GPA.
			GPA / CGPA / SGPA :- Grade Point Average is the average of grades obtained by a student. It is broadly categorized into two types :-
			1.	SGPA – SEMESTER GPA refers to the average of grades obtained in any particular semester.
			2.	CGPA – COMMULATIVE GPA refers to average of grades obtained overall from 1st semester to the current semester of the student. Most of the companies consider this during the recruitments. 

			<h3>RULE REGARDING F GRADE IN CALCULATION</h3>
				<p class="define">Only 5 (O A B C D E) grades are counted while calculating GPA in CCT. If a student obtains F Grade in one or  more subjects then the subject is not counted towards the GPA. It is in the favour of students as otherwise an F Grade will drastically harm the GPA for any student. </p>
			<h3>Formula Used</h3>
				<p class="define">This SGPA cum CGPA calculator follows the given procedure. All the formulae (written in blue) used are mentioned here for reference. </p> 
			<ol>
				<li>Grade Points = Grade Obtained * Credits </li>
				<li>Total Grade Points are calculated by adding all the grade points. </li>
				<li>Total Credit Hours are calculated by adding all the credit hours. </li>
				<li>GPA = (Total Grade Points) / (Total Credit Hours) </li>
			</ol>
FOR CALCULATING CGPA
1.	Previous CGPA * No. of Semesters passed. (Please note that you have to enter CGPA upto last semester and not the SGPA of last semester)
2.	CGPA = {(Previous CGPA * no. of semesters) + Current GPA} / (No. of Semesters + 1)
