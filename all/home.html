  <strong>About the Center </strong><br>
<p align="justify">The  world economy is undergoing&nbsp; fundamental  
structural changes driven by the globalization of business on the one 
hand and  by the revolution in Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) on the  other. World economy may find a new equilibrium in the 
coming decades mainly  because of the emergence of a set of changes 
based on synergies and confluence  of Nanotechnology, Bioinformatics 
&amp; Biotechnology, Information &amp;  Communication Technology and 
Cognitive &amp; Neuroscience (NBIC). The  integration and synergy of 
these four technologies originate from nanoscale  where the building 
blocks of matter are established. Each of these technologies  is 
currently progressing at a rapid rate. The Center for Converging  
Technologies (CCT) at the University of Rajasthan is conceptualized as a
 centre  to strengthen quality education and to pursue high standard 
research in the  frontier areas of NBIC technologies so as to accelerate
 techno-economic  development of the country.</p>
<p><strong>The centre is  pursuing the following activities:</strong><strong> </strong></p>

<ul type="disc">
  <li>Creating and maintaining a critical mass of Converging 
Technologies research specialists who can effectively contribute to the 
need of the industry and society. It focuses on research in areas like 
Nanoscience and Nanotechnology,Bioinformatics, Biotechnology, 
Information and Communication Technology. </li>
  <li>Founding a strong training and research base in academia to make 
an attractive international training ground for Converging Technologies;
 Generating, designing,and applying new technologies in an innovative 
way. </li>
  <li>Developing laboratories and facilities to efficiently engineer and design new products. </li>
  <li>Promoting global level research in allied theoretical Science 
(logic, data structures and algorithms, computational complexity, 
database systems, knowledge representations, constraint satisfactions, 
artificialintelligence, intelligent agents, theoretical computer science
 and quantum computing), Systems Biology and Metabolomics. </li>
  <li>Making special provisions to attract post-doctoral students in Converging Technologies to uplift the capacity for research. </li>
  <li>Imparting postgraduate education in Converging Technologies. </li>

  <li>Collaborating with Industry, National and International Institutes/Universities to augment research and achieve its objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Infrastructure  Facilities</strong><strong> </strong><br></p>
 <p align="justify">The University has received financial support under 
Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme for creation of the 
centre on recommendations of Hon'ble Ex-Member of Parliament Shri R.P. 
Goenka. The first phase of Centre's new building has been completed in 
2009. It has specifically been designed to meet the requirements of 
Converging Technologies research and education activities. It has fully 
networked, well-furnished, air-conditioned, dust and germ free research 
labs and class rooms. A State of the Art research infrastructure is 
being created with assistance from various funding agencies and through 
public private partnership. &nbsp;The &nbsp;centre&nbsp; houses BIF 
facilities supported by Department of Biotechnology, Government of 
India. The centre  has been selected as nodal centre for the 
DBT-supported IPLS programme under which a grant of Rs. 10 Crores has 
been sanctioned by Govt. of India. Sixteen  students will be awarded 
fellowship in last two year of the course under the programme, The 
second phase of CCT building is  being constructed out of the IPLS 
support and CCTs own fund. It  is likely to  be ready by August 2012. 
Research equipment worth four crores will be procured under IPLS 
programme. The Hon’ble Chief Minister Shri Ashok Gehlot, has announced 
in his budget speech in 2011 [State Budget Announcement No. 155]to setup
 a budgetary support to setup a “Centre of Excellence for Nano 
Technologies” at Centre for Converging Technologies.</p>

<p align="justify">The Centre has an MoU for research collaborations, 
faculty and student exchange with the Royal Melbourne Institute of 
Technology (RMIT) University, Melbourne, Australia. The Centre plans to 
collaborate with leading International Universities and Research 
Institutes to foster research in Converging Technologies. Students of 
CCT  have received financial support under Student Project scheme of 
Department of Science and Technology, Government of Rajasthan. It is 
also a beneficiary unit under  DST-PURSE  granted by Department of 
Science and Technology, Government of India to University of Rajasthan, 
Jaipur based on high h-index of university among top institutes of 
science and technology in India. The centre has also achieved a 
distinction with a few students publishing papers in peer reviewed 
journals during master course. Students have undertaken training in X 
Semester at premiere research institutes like BARC, IISc, IITs,  IIITs, 
CSIO, DRDO, NCL, NPL, NBRC, NIMHANS, INMAS, CEERI, SAMEER, DIAT, IGCAR, 
CGCRI.  The students have undertaken training at R&amp;D units of 
leading companies like Reliance Life Science, Reliance Textile, Shalimar
 Paints, ARCI.   It has a plan to publish an online  journal in 
Converging Technologies and organize an annual conference on Recent 
Advances in Converging Technologies.  Several students have qualified 
NET, GATE, JEST and GRE. On an average every student is attending about 
five conferences/workshops during the course. </p>

<p><strong>Ph.D. Programme</strong><strong> </strong><br></p>
<p align="justify">The primary aim of establishing the Centre for 
Converging Technologies (CCT) is to produce high quality research in the
 four streams of Nanotechnology, Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, 
Information and Communication Technology, Cognitive &amp; Neuroscience 
so as to create new scientific methodologies, engineering paradigms  and
 industrial products. The focus will be on key areas relevant to the 
desired rapid growth of the Indian economy.</p>
